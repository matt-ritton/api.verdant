# üçÉ Verdant: Image Classification Tool for Plant Diseases
**Verdant** is a prototype mobile application for diagnosing phytopathologies (plant diseases), developed as part of the Capstone Project for the Information Systems program at the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

## About this repository
This repository contains the code responsible for the development of the project's API. The project uses a reduced-scope version of the [PlantVillage](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1) dataset. For information about the mobile application, please visit the [related repository](https://github.com/matt-ritton/app.verdant).
